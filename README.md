Project Description: Anemia Prediction
The Anemia Prediction project, hosted at https://github.com/sudarshanaghade/anemia_prediction, is a machine learning initiative aimed at predicting anemia in individuals using key hematological features derived from blood test data. This project leverages a dataset containing attributes such as Gender, Hemoglobin, Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH), Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC), and Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) to classify individuals as anemic or non-anemic. The primary goal is to develop an accurate predictive model that can assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and intervention for anemia, a condition characterized by insufficient red blood cells or hemoglobin levels, which can lead to significant health complications if untreated.

The project employs a Random Forest classifier, a robust ensemble machine learning algorithm, to analyze the input features and predict the binary outcome (0 for non-anemic, 1 for anemic). Exploratory data analysis, including correlation analysis (e.g., a strong negative correlation of -0.796 between Hemoglobin and anemia status), informs feature selection and model development. Visualizations such as decision tree plots (e.g., using plot_tree from scikit-learn) provide insights into the model's decision-making process, enhancing interpretability.

This repository serves as a foundation for building a practical tool for anemia detection, with potential applications in medical diagnostics. While the current codebase focuses on model development and analysis, future enhancements could include integration into a web application for real-time predictions, as demonstrated in related work. Contributions are welcome to refine the model, expand the dataset, or develop a user-friendly interface for broader accessibility.
