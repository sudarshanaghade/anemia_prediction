Project Description: Anemia Prediction
The Anemia Prediction project, hosted at https://github.com/sudarshanaghade/anemia_prediction, is a machine learning initiative aimed at predicting anemia in individuals using key hematological features derived from blood test data. This project leverages a dataset containing attributes such as Gender, Hemoglobin, Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH), Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC), and Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) to classify individuals as anemic or non-anemic. The primary goal is to develop an accurate predictive model that can assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and intervention for anemia, a condition characterized by insufficient red blood cells or hemoglobin levels, which can lead to significant health complications if untreated.
